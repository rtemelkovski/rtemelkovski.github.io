				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<div class="line-separator"></div>
				<p>
				I am Computer Science student at McMaster University living in Toronto, Ontario, Canada for my internship.
				I started my internship at the beginning of May 2017 and it goes until the end of April 2018.
				In my spare time, I enjoy taking on programming projects, writing and producing music, going out to explore the city I'm in
				and learning about new things.
				</p>
				<p>
				I enjoy doing both front-end and back-end development and I get to try out both and find out what I like and dislike about both at work.
				Front-end development allows me to approach development from more of an artistic side with design, but it also allows me to put myself in the user's shoes to think about whether a design is easy to use. Back-end development, on the other hand, allows me to approach development from a more logical side where it's important to make sure that the product is designed in a way that makes the code base easily maintainable, extensible, efficient, and scalable.
				</p>
				<p>
				For my personal projects I like to try using many different languages, however the languages I've used the most in my own personal projects are Python, C++, Javascript and Java. You can check out a few of my projects <a href="projects.html">here</a> or go to <a href="https://github.com/rtemelkovski">Github</a> for a more detailed view of all of them.
